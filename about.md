My name is Kyle Hiroyasu and I am a recent graduate from the University of Utah.
I am interested in a career in data science and expanding my practical skillsets
to improve the impact of my work.  I am currently interested in applying machine
learning and data visualization to understand data.

In my free time I enjoy skiing, rock climbing, and highlining.

This website will primarily focus on data science topics and ideas I've come
across. I plant to include projects and technologies that have piqued my
interest.
